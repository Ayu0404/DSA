### Data Storage
1. Bit - s the smallest unit of storage, representing a binary value of 0 or 1.
2. Byte - is a collection of 8 bits. It represents 2^8 = 256 different values.

A character takes 1 byte.
An integer takes 2 bytes.
A float takes 4 bytes.

3. Types of Data Types - 
    - Primitive Data types - are defined by the systems and are provided by programming languages like int, float, char, bool.
    - Secondary (User Defined) Data types - like structure (struct keyword in C/C++), class in java/ python

4. Data Structures - are a structure formed by data stored in memory. It can be defined in two ways - 
    - Linear Data Structures - Data structures that can be assessed sequentially but may/ may not be stored sequentially in the memory. Eg - Linked List, Stacks and Queue
    - Non Linear Data Structures - Data structures that are stored non linearly. Eg - Graphs and Tree

5. Abstract Data Types - are secondary data types - user defined. Unlike primitive data types, they do not have pre-defined helper functions to perform even the basic operations like add or subtract. This is where ADT comes in - 
    - Declaration of data
    - Declaration of operations
Eg - Linked Lists, Stacks, Queues, Priority Queues, Binary Trees, Dictionaries, Disjoint Sets (Union and Find), Hash Tables, Graphs etc.

6. Rate of Growth - The rate at which the running time increases as a function of input (data structure) is called rate of growth.
    -   In decreasing order 
        - 2^2n
        - 2^2n
        - n!
        - 4^n
        - 2^n
        - n^2
        - n log n
        - n
        - 2^log n
        - log^2 n
        - (log n)^ 1/2
        - log log n 
        - 1

### Recursion and backtracking

1. Recursion means calling a copy of itself (function) multiple times. It is often used in sorting and searching problems.
