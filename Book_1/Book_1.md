* The Big O Notation explains the upper bound time complexity.
* The Big Omega Notation explains the lower bound time complexity.


## 1. Time Complexity
* Best Case - O(N) - linear time or O(1) - constant time
* Expected Case - O(N log N)
* Worst Case - O(N ^2^)

For most algorithms, the expected and the worst case are the same.

## 2. Space Complexity
* One Dimensional Space - O(N) 
* One Dimensional Space - O(N ^2^)
